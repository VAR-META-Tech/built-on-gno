**Gnoland** is a Layer 1 blockchain project initiated in 2020 by Jae Kwon, the co-founder of Cosmos and Tendermint. It aims to create a decentralized, secure, and scalable smart contract platform that allows people to develop significant applications, especially those resistant to censorship.

Gnoland is developed based on a fork of Tendermint called New Tendermint, while the original Tendermint has now been renamed to Ignite. New Tendermint focuses on simplifying the Tendermint framework and uses Gno as the toolkit for new Cosmos projects.

Gnoland also offers a programming language called Gnolang, a concurrent programming language similar to Go, which can be seen as a subset of Go with additional security features suitable for smart contract programming. It can run multi-user and multi-chain smart contracts on the Gno virtual machine, also known as Realm. Gnoland requires developers to upload their source code to the chain rather than the compiled bytecode, enhancing the transparency and readability of smart contracts.

As of March 2023, Gnoland is hosting a global competition called Game of Realms, encouraging developers to write the best smart contracts using Gnolang, with substantial rewards on offer.
