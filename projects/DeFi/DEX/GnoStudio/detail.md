- Exceptional developer experience is integral to the Gno ecosystem, shaping the special programming language, Gno, and guiding the features of Gno.land. The technology stack is designed to offer developers an unparalleled platform for crafting next-generation dApps via realms (smart contracts).
- As Gno.land expands into a universe of realms, development tools become instrumental to enable innovation and ingenuity. To fully realize this vision, we are creating Gno Studio, empowering community members to create and use succinct and composable realms on Gno.land.

**The Gno Studio Developer Experience**

- The Gno Studio suite will offer extensive builder tools tailored for Gno.land. The design of Gno Studio is intended to cater to a wide range of users, from experienced builders to non-coders, by simplifying and enhancing the process of launching any realm or application you can imagine. Initially, Gno Studio started as a proof of concept IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Eventually, this evolved into a vision for a comprehensive suite of apps and services — Gno Studio — designed to elevate the developer experience to new heights and meet users’ and builders’ current needs and expectations.

- At the end of last year, we launched the first beta application of the Gno Studio suite, Gno Playground, as part of the Gno.land brand. The official Playground of Gno.land is a minimalistic IDE that facilitates the creation, testing, deployment, and sharing of Gno code. It is a powerful tool designed to simplify the development of packages and realms, lowering the barrier to entry for new builders and enhancing the productivity of advanced Go developers.

- Today, we are excited to announce the beta release of Gno Studio Connect, the second application in the Gno Studio suite.

**Your Gateway to Experience the Power of Realms**

- Gno Studio Connect is a tool that simplifies access and interaction with realm functions. Whether you’re exploring realms like the Gno.land blog, engaging with a realm deployed through the Gno Playground, or using a tool like gnokey, Connect makes interaction easy.

- The initial version of Connect focuses on function calls, enabling users to interact with any realm’s exposed function(s) on Gno.land. Function calls are performed through your account using any wallet that supports Gno.land (currently, Adena is the only supported wallet.) Let’s discuss the feature set:
- Access: Directly input a realm path and select the corresponding network in the interface for seamless navigation to your realm.
- Explore: Discover the available functions of any realm and their details through a dedicated function list.
- Interact: Swiftly make calls through a dedicated function interface by selecting a specific function in the realm’s function list.
- Evaluate: Review and analyze the outcomes of your interactions with realm functions by assessing results and determine any further actions required.
- Share: Copy links to realms, functions and results and share with anyone, making it easy to request engagement on a realm or feedback on a specific function.
- Track: Keep track of your previous realm interactions, where you can view the results of your function calls and revisit their results through a historical overview.
